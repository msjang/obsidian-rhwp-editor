# Release Notes

This English file is the source for GitHub Release automation. Korean companion notes live in `RELEASE_NOTES_KO.md`.

## 0.2.6

### Added

- Added an `Open in default app` toolbar action for HWP/HWPX views, available from both read-only and edit modes.
- Added a command palette action to open the current HWP/HWPX file with the system default app.

### Fixed

- Fixed editor print preview being blocked as a popup inside Obsidian by routing rHWP's existing print preview flow through an Obsidian popout view.

### Changed

- Updated the bundled `rhwp` runtime to `0.7.15`.

## 0.2.4

### Fixed

- Re-published the edit mode asset-loading fixes from `0.2.3` under a clean release tag after the `0.2.3` release workflow was retried with a moved tag.
- Fixed edit mode showing raw `rhwp-studio` menu HTML without CSS in Obsidian.
- Fixed edit mode failing to load files with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '__wbindgen_malloc')` after rhwp WASM initialization failed inside the iframe.
- Fixed missing SVG sprite icons in the edit mode toolbar and menus.

### Changed

- Edit mode generates an Obsidian-specific `rhwp-studio-obsidian/` runtime entrypoint before opening the iframe.
- The generated entrypoint inlines CSS and the main JS bundle, rewrites font and renderer URLs for Obsidian resource loading, and passes rhwp WASM bytes directly instead of relying on iframe `app://` fetch.
- Uses a fresh `0.2.4` tag instead of reusing the problematic `0.2.3` tag.

## 0.2.3

### Changed
